# Principles for designing services responding to Covid-19

1. [Have a shared team goal](http://www.myddelton.co.uk/blog/building-local-welcome-by-tackling-our-riskiest-assumptions) about what we’re doing and why
2. [Focus on unmet needs, for now and later](https://medium.com/digital-and-innovation-at-british-red-cross/mapping-unmet-needs-f0cf830b307d)
3. Make it work with [little or no touching](https://twitter.com/Deliveroo/status/1240334705981095937) and [face-to-face contact](https://twitter.com/yahoo_pete/status/1233834806158516226)
4. Make it still work with little or [no internet connection](https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/urgent-and-emergency-care/nhs-111/)
5. [Allow friends and family to use it for others](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/caring-carers-and-long-term-conditions/can-i-pick-up-a-prescription-for-someone-else/)
6. Be open about how information is used
[Remember to still make the service usable and accessible](https://twitter.com/timpaul/status/1239851793112276993)
7. Test with frontline colleagues before going live
8. Operate remotely, [delivery locally](https://reserves.redcross.org.uk/)
9. Deliver reliably over weeks and months
10. Spread team knowledge for how to operate and fix things
11. Generate data automatically about how service is performing
13. Let other organisations join and copy what works
14. Collaborate, don’t compete
15. [Have open plans other teams can see](https://trello.com/b/U4uyig9o/suport-line-roadmap)
